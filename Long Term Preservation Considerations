Long Term Preservation Considerations : Data: The data should be preservable in the long term. The format was chosen by a group with long term preservation being considered. The processed and raw data is also able to be accessed via any software. It can be opened using excel or numbers.
Metadata: The metadata on the other hand I am less sure about. One file is XML. This I am less worried about because it is a very standard format that is easily accessible. The other metadata however is in  TTL format. This format requires specific software to open. Now while the software is easily findable via searching the internet, the only software that works to open it appears to be fan funded and there is nothing easily accessible say on the windows or apple store. While perfectly fine now this less official format could easily result in the data having nothing to open it in the future.
